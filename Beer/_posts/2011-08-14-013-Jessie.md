## Notes
GFI had a better crush so efficiency was up quite a bit. Gran bag ripped before mashing in and I lost somewhere between .5# and 1# grain. This is this is reflected by lowering the amount of 2 row on the recipie sheet. Recipie originally called for 9 lbs. This loss of grain was counteracted by the increase in efficiency. Heated strike 16.25 qts to 165ish. After mash in temp right around 148F. Mashed for 60 min. Sparged with about 21 qts. Ended up with about 7 gal for boil. First use of hop spider, first use of whole leaf hops. Cooled to about 85F then ran off to bucket. I didn&#39;t use the paint strainer in the bucket and it seemed like a lot of trub made it in so I will use the paint strainer and the hop spider next time. Stirred in 1 pkg US-05 at about 80F. Moved to basement with blue rubber band on airlock. Racked to carboy after 13 days added 1 oz whole leaf citra hops. Gravity at transfer 1.012. Might have moved it a little too early since there was still a bit of krausen left on top.

## Notes
Missed mash temp, mashed 144-145 for 80 min. Pitched 1.8 liter starter. Moved to garage after 1 night in basement. Garage temps have moved up to 90\* ambient over 1.5 weeks. 

Checked gravity on 6/30 1.05. Still seems to be off gassing quite a bit though. 

Checked again on 7/8 now at 1.024, ambient temps in the garage have remained very high, outdoor temps between 95-105 diring the day. Hydrometer sample tasted great but still a little too sweet. 

Checked again 7/14 doesn&#39;t look like it made too much progress but there was a new krausen and increased airlock activity, I stirred it up some more so hopefully this new activity will finish it off.

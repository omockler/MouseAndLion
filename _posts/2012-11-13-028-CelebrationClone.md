## Notes
A shame I lost last years recipie. First brew with the march pump. Had an awesome mash, hit temps well and came pretty close to correct water volume. ended up with about 7.2 gal pre boil. Boiled a little extra to bring that down, pretty close to 80 min. Fermented at ambient basement temps.

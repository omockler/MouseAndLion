## Notes
Mashed at 148 for 60 min. Pitched one package US-05 into a carboy so probaby only about 4.9 gallons. I was too worried to use my hydrometer so who knows what the OG of this was. This thing went totally nuts and blew out the blow-off hose. Down to 1.013 after two weeks, kegged with 2oz amarillo dry hops. It had a ton of overripe pineapple scent, jess said she liked it but it was a little solventy to me.

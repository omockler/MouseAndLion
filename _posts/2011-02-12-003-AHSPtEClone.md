## Yeast
DCL Yeast SafBrew Ale

## Notes
Extra Pale  LME, US-05 yeast.
Steeped grains at 155\* for 25 min. Temp dropped to 148\* during steep. Added LME and brought to a boil. Added hops to schedule. Forgot to add sugar untill 30min left. Partial boil volume of approx 3.5 gal. O.G. 1.068. Pitched yeast at 70\*. Moved to secondary at 17 days and dry hopped. Bottled using 4 oz. corn sugar. Transfered back to carboy and strained to bottleing bucket for second time to remove extra hop particals. Probably wouldn&#39;t do that again. Yeilded 39 bottles

## Notes
Forgot to take mash notes like a sucker, if I remember right mashed about 90 min after missing temps a little. Ended up with 5.5 gals at  exactly 1.055. Planning on putting it on 9# mulberries from the Roby farm. 

Added all the mulberries and there was a bit of additional fermentation. 

This ended up being a pretty interesting beer, but I don&#39;t think I will ever use nearly as many mulberries. Tasted a little &quot;wine-y&quot; at first and has quite a bit of tartness. Maybe next time add a bit less friut and then add some k-meta to kill any sourness before it becomes overwhelming?

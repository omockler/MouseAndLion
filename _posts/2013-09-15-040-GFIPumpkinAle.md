## Notes
15 oz canned pumpkin at first wort.
Spices Added with 10 min. left:
1/4 tsp Nutmeg
1/2 tsp Cinnamon
1/2 tsp Vanilla
1/2 tsp Pumpkin Pie spice
1/4 tsp Ginger

Mashed with a little over 4 gallons of water at 155\* for an hour. Collected 7.5 gal after sparging with 5 gallons at 171\*.  Boiled hard to get down to about 5.7 gallons into the fermentor. Pitched at ~75\*

Overall this batch has gotten pretty good reviews. I think that it is a little off in the spicyness and I also don&#39;t like that the pumpkin in the boil made it smell like gerber baby summer squash. Probably wouldn&#39;t brew again unless someone asked for it.

## Notes
Spilled some grain out of the sack on the way from the store after the bag ripped. Maybe a 1/4# or so?

Mashed at 150\* for 70 min. Seems as if the manifold came a little loose since the mash was still really wet when cleaning up. Collected a little less than 5 gallons at 1.072. Pitched 1 pack of US-05. Finished at 1.018 after 3 weeks kegged with 4oz simcoe.

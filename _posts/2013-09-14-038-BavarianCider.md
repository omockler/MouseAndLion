## Grain

| Name | Amount %|
| ---- | ------: |
| Apple Cider | 97.3 
| Candi Sugar, Dark | 2.60 

## Yeast
Wyeast Labs Bavarian Wheat Yeast

## Notes
4.5 gallons of Anderson orchard cider
1 pouch Extra dark candi sugar (180)
1 Pack wy3056

This batch had a pretty active fermentation and blew the air lock off of the carboy. Added in about a quart of unfermented frozen cider back at kegging time for a little sweetness. Ended up tasting probably a little bit better than the english yeast. For some reason it refuses to carb, even after close to 3 weeks on CO2 it nearly flat.

## Grain

| Name | Amount %|
| ---- | ------: |
| Apple Cider | 97.3 
| Candi Sugar, Dark | 2.60 

## Yeast
Lallemand Nottingham Yeast

## Notes
4.5 gallons Anderson orchard cider
1 pouch Dark candi sugar (90)
1 pack Nottingham yeast

This batch had a less active fermentation than the bavarian weat version, but ended up a little lower. Both batches under the 1.000 mark. At kegging time I added back in about a quart of unfermented frozen cider for backsweetening. Slightly sharp at the end, but that could be down to having better carbonation than this years other batch.

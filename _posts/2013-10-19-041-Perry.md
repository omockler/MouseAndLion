## Grain

## Yeast


## Notes
I got about a bushel of pears from Jess&#39;s grandparents. Sean and I built the standard ghetto internet inspired fruit press from some 2x4&#39;s and a bottle jack. We hosed off the pears then dipped them into star san. The sanitizer was followed up with a food processor, then into the press. We ended up with about 2.5 gallons of juice and it tasted great. Added a whole pack of notty even though that was probably over kill. After a few weeks this was tasting great!

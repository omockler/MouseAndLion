## Notes
Made a starter on 7/5 for the lacto. Left it on the stirplate upstaris for 2 days before brewing.

Mashed in with 9qts at 168\*. Left for 80 min at 148\*. It&#39;s such a small beer that I opted for a mash out/sparge combo step and added 4.25 gal at 175\* before collecting any runnings. Collected 5.25 into the boil kettle with 1oz Haller as FWH. Heated to 180\* then let sit for about 5 min. Cooled to 100\* and moved to a carboy and pitched the lacto starter. OG measured at 1.032 and I left about a gallon behind that wouldn&#39;t fit in the carboy with the starter. Next time I should just do a 10 gallon batch. Left it as lacto only for a week, then pitched 1 pack US-05. Down to 1.008 after 3 weeks and tasting pretty good. I would like it if it was a little more on the tart side, but we&#39;ll see after carbonation. Kegged 9/28

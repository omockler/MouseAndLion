## Notes
Mashed at 154 for 60 min. Cooled to 72 then transfered and pitched. Boil off was high and ended up with just under 5 gal when losses were acounted for after runnung off 7 gal.

Kegged on 6/2/13. FG 1.016. Tastes great out so far.

Indiana State Fair 2013: 26.
Notes indicated that it was a littel too dark and the carbonation was a little too low. I totally agree that it is too dark. It seemed darker than my first PTE brew so I should look into that. It could have also used a little more bitterness.

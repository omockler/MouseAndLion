## Notes
I might have gotten in over my head on this one. Mashed in two batches and each batch still almost maxes out the mash tun. Also the hops should have been all Hallertauer and Columbus but I ran out of Columbus and just used the Simcoe to get close to the original IBU.

First mash about 27lbs of grain with about 8.5 gallons of water at 165\*. A little hard to be sure since that is more grain than fits in a 5 gallon bucket to measure &amp; more water than what fits in the HLT. Ended up at about 154\*, left for 60 min. It looks like quite a bit of the roasted grains ended up in this portion but it&#39;s hard to say. Collected 5 gals first runnings and 2.5 after sparge. Won&#39;t beable to fit that same amount in the kettle so I brought that to a vigous boil to get down to \* gals.

Second mash had about the same ratios but probably a little heac=vier on the grains and also included the flaked oats. Mash temp about 150\* this time. Hopefully this doesn&#39;t dry out too much.

Cooled to 72\*. Collected two buckets, each about 5.5 gal and both got 30 sec of O2. Two packs of US-05, 1.5 packs of S-04 for the other.

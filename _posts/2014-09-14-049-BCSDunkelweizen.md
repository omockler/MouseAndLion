## Notes
Totally screwed the pooch here. Grabbed this bag of grain instead of the Brett IPA that I was meaning to brew. The mash was stupid too ended up mashing at 142-4\* ish for about 90 min. I really don&#39;t trust that therometer anymore. This was supposed to use hallertauer but I didn&#39;t realize I had the wrong grain till after I used the first addition of Amarillo. I also planned on making a starter but no time for that now :(

Collected about 5 gals at 1.070 and pitched an older smack pack of 3638. No idea how that happened. Doesn&#39;t seem at all possible. Lets see how this works out.

Moved to a keg on 10/7, down to 1.013. Tasted a little an the rubbing alcohol side, I think those yeast must have been really stressed with no starter. I&#39;ll bottle this one and hope it cleans up.

## Notes
First stab at temp mashing. At first I was going to go with a strike of about .5qts/gal but I had a hard time getting all the grain wet at that temp so I went up to .7qts/gal. After adding 1.5 gallons at 154 it seems I missed the first rest. Started at about 139\*.  After 20 min I added a little less than a gallon at 160\* and we are a bit closer now about 147\* for the next 40 min rest. After 40 min the mash had stabilized at 145\*. I added just over a gallon @203\* and it looked to be about 161\* for the final 30 min. Collected 3.5 gal of first runnings. Then I noticed that I forgot to add the flaked corn, oh well next time I guess. Added 3 gal @171\* ended up with a little less than 7 gal pre boil. I also added the hops a bit early so they will be somewhere between a 60 min addition and FWH.

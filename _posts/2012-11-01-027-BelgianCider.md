## Yeast
Wyeast Labs Trappist High Gravity

## Notes
Did some kind of micro mash of 1# special B in about 1.3 qts of water. After that sat for about 1.5 hrs I sparged with another 2 qts water at 175 ish. Boiled that for about an hour and got down to about 1.25 qts. Cooled with .5 gal cider. I then added that and the remaining 3.5 gals cider to the fermentor. Pitched trappist yeast and fermented at ambient basement tempetures. Cant remember the exact gravity but it was in the 1.05 range. 

Tasted 11/10 
Gravity down to about 1.003. Tastes AWESOME. Still smells a little sulfury. Gonna let it sit for another couple of days. I might have to try to purge the sulfur with CO2 in the keg.

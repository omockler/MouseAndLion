## Notes
Mashed in with about 15.5 qts according to 7.5 gl boil kettle. Sparged with 20+ qts. Boil off in the keggle seemed lower than in old kettle. Could also be due to high humidity. The peaches were cubed, then frozen. Before adding them to the bucket I pasturized them by bringing them up to 150F in stock pot then putting them in an oven preheated to 170 for 20 min. I then cooled them in the fridge. Racked to secondary on top of about 6.5 lbs peaches, after 9 days. Left on peaches for 12 days. Kegged on 8/26/11. Final gravity 1.007

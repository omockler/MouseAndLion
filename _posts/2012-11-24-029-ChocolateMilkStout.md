## Notes
From northern brewer. Beer smith doesnt have the grains that came with the kit. Userd Fawcett Pale Chocolate (180-250L) and English Extra Dark Crystal (160L). Mashed with about 3.5 gallons of water. Mash temp 154\* for 65 min. Sparged with 4 gallons of 170\* water. I forgot to stir the grain bed during the batch sparge so I probably lost some sugars there. Ran off just about 6 gallons to the fermentor. The boil was a little longer than 60 min since I added the lactose about half way in and turned off the element to prevent scorching. Cooled to 76\* then transfered to fermenting bucket. Gave it 30 sec O2 then pitched 1 pack s-04.

## Notes
Made a 2 liter starter fo 3787 from some second runnings of last weeks batch of jessie. Mashed at about 152 for 70 min. Lauter manifold came loose after first runnings so there ended up beeing some spent huskes in the wort, hopefully it doesn&#39;t cause too much of an issue. Boiled 7 gallons for 80 min. Kettle said about 5.5 gallons but spilled some while transfering. Poured off about 1 liter of the starter then pitched the rest at about 69\* F. OG 1.064.

Indiana state fair 2013: 30.5
General impression was that it needed a little higher mash temp and maybe a bit more kettle carmelization.

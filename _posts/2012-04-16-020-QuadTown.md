## Yeast


## Notes
Mashed at 154-155 for 60 min. Boiled for 90 min. Pitched onto yeast cake from 017-Redemption WLP 530. Fermentation sotopped early. Something like 1.055. Using an electric blanket I got it down to 1.045 after another 2.5 weeks. Ended up racking to the keg too early after cooling this beer was just way too sweet. Eventually I pitched a 2L starter of 1056 to try and dry it out a little.

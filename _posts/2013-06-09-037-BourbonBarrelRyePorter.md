## Notes
Munich II
Simpsons Medium Crystal

Mash in started at about 155\*. I didn&#39;t take too long warming up the mash tun so after 75 min the mash was down to the right temp of about 151\*. Collected about 6.5 gallons pre boil. Boil went according to plan. Cooled to 70\* and pitched a mason jar worth of slurry from the prevoius batch of oatmeal stout. OG was a little low at about 1.054.

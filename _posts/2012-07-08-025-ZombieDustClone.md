## Notes

Barely hit 150 for mash temp after adding a pint of boiling water. Way overshot strike and sparge water. Probably ended with about 2 extra gallons between extra sencond runnings and extra wort after the boil. Really low SG due to volumes. Started at about 1.05, piched 1 pack s-04 after 1.5 min of O2. Fermentation really took off.
